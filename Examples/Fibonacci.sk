#this program finds the Nth term in the fibonacci sequence
SET ONE 25
SET TWO 0
SET THREE 1
#here ONE is the N value, while TWO and THREE are A and B
SET FOUR -1
#I set it to negative one because the first time it is incremented in the loop it is actually incrementing, so this is to counterbalance it
#FOUR acts as C, which will store the next term before it's transfered to B

LOOP A
INC FOUR THREE
INC FOUR TWO
#C = A + B
OUT FOUR
SET TWO THREE
SET THREE FOUR
#A = B, B = C
SET FOUR 0
#C = 0
DEC ONE
#N -= 1
JMPG ONE -1 A
#I set this to negative one because the zeroth term is included in the series
#This solution might seem odd, but it provides the full series up to N
