# MyLanguage
A simple language I made based off of assembly language and the basics of BrainF. It has loops and such should be Turing complete.

It operates through commands and registers. The registers are ONE-TEN.

Command examples:
INC ONE - increase register ONE by 1
INC ONE 5 - increase register ONE by 5
INC ONE TWO - increase register ONE by the value stored in register TWO

DEC ONE - decrease register ONE by 1
DEC ONE 5 - decrease register ONE by 5
DEC ONE TWO - decrease register ONE by the value stored in register TWO
